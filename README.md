# tiny-pov

Work in progress, come back soon for more.

Tiny-pov is a low cost, high performance, persistence of vision display built with the ATtiny1616.
The goal if this project is to explore cost effective and easily manufacturable electrical design.

The current plan is to use an ATtiny1616 to relay data from a SD Card directly into a string of APA102 LEDs. The arm will be inductively powered using coils built into the PCB to keep cost low.
