Work in progress, check back soon for more.

[Checkout the GUI](http://michael-crum.com/tiny-pov/) for a sneak peak.

Tiny-pov is a low cost, high performance, persistence of vision display built with the STM32G0.
This project is designed to explore cost effective and easily manufacturable mechatronic design.

I currently plan to use a STM32G0 to relay data from a SD Card directly into a string of APA102 LEDs. The arm will be inductively powered using custom coils.
